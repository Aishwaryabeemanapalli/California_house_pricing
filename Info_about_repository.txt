For creating new repository in Github, I am using all the below checklist in creating new repo.
Add a readme file.
.gitignore template is set to "Python" - The main reason being my coding is entirely done in Python and some of the files that are present in python
need not be commited every single time I am trying to update my code. 
Any license can be picked up. Here we picked - Apache License 2.0


After writing requirements.txt file. You have to configure GIT
git config --global user.name "[USERNAME]"
git config --global user.email "[EMAIL ID]"

Whichever files we don't want to commit we can add them to git ignore file as file path. 

App.py  
We are using predict_api() method to find predictions. 
The json object is used for the data. 
We need to have data.values() because json has data in the form of key-value pairs.
This won't be sufficient so we convert to list. 
With respect to pickling we did, we need to do reshape. So we convert to np.array(list(data.values())).reshape(1,-1)
The reason why we are doing 1,-1 is because this is the single data record we are going to get 
and now we have to take this and do transformation. 
Standardization expects single data record. 
Now we need to import the scaling pickle file.
