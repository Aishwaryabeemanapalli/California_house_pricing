For creating new repository in Github, I am using all the below checklist in creating new repo.
Add a readme file.
.gitignore template is set to "Python" - The main reason being my coding is entirely done in Python and some of the files that are present in python
need not be commited every single time I am trying to update my code. 
Any license can be picked up. Here we picked - Apache License 2.0


After writing requirements.txt file. You have to configure GIT
git config --global user.name "[USERNAME]"
git config --global user.email "[EMAIL ID]"

Whichever files we don't want to commit we can add them to git ignore file as file path.
